This will be where I test my git skills.

See?  I can edit stuff.

How do I keep track of things?  Or do I just commit to a specific branch every time I change something?  Can I make edits in the Xcode editor from the command line? Do I keep using a bunch of different folders?  Kind of icky.

Apparently your branches are affiliated with a given git folder in a given folder, so you canâ€™t keep them in different folders.  Maybe continue making edits in random folders and then copy it over to that folder when you want to commit?  Seems weird.
